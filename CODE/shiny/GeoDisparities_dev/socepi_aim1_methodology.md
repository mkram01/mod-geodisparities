#### Methodology

Our group currently has access to restricted-access NCHS natality
records from 1989-2016. To achieve this Aim and address the four
critical areas described above, we will estimate (and map) the
prevalence of very preterm birth (&lt;32 weeks); late preterm birth
(34-36 weeks); and preterm birth (&lt;37 weeks) for each U.S. county
overall, and for non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black women
separately.

We will further estimate (and map) the county-specific Black-White
relative and absolute disparities. To produce stable and valid estimates
of both the risks and the disparity measures we will implement spatial
Bayesian disease mapping techniques, which ‘borrow’ statistical strength
for spatiotemporal dependencies (9–11). These have been widely
validated, are frequently used, and my team has used them for estimating
perinatal and mortality parameters in US counties(12–16).

While some counties will still be suppressed (e.g. there are no Black
births in many counties), the number of counties with estimates is
substantially higher with these methods than when following NCHS
suppression rules, and all estimates are more valid than approaches
ignoring data sparseness (10).
