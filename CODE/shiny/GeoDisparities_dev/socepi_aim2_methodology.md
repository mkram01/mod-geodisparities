#### Methodology

We have assembled a unique set of county-level indicators of social and
economic context that represent potentially policy-modifiable factors
that could vary by race and geography, and that are plausibly related to
known pathways to preterm birth (e.g. they may influence social support,
chronic economic stress, and lack of quality health care).

The indicators include measures of:

-   Material capital (e.g. median household income, poverty rate)
-   Social capital (e.g. crime rate, % housing instability/turnover)
-   Human capital (e.g. % unemployed, % changed jobs in last year, % at
    various levels attained education)
-   Local measures of economic fragility (e.g. % food insecure, cost of
    living including % spending &gt;30% on housing)
-   Economic safety net (e.g. % WIC, % SNAP, % of tax returns with
    EITC).

These data come from PolicyMap.org, the Census Bureau, and other
aggregators of demographic and economic data.

We explore associations between these contextual variables and preterm
birth (overall and by race) to understand how these factors affect
prevalence. Separately, we examine the association of contextual
variables with the *magnitude* of the Black-White disparity (relative or
absolute) to identify correlates of between-group variance.
