**March of Dimes Geodisparities tool**
======================================

<br>

Despite decades of clinical and population research, the problem of
large and unacceptable racial, economic, and geographic disparities in
preterm birth persist. Inadequate integration of theoretical and
methodological insight from clinical, epidemiologic, and social science
research impedes progress towards impactful action to eliminate inequity
in preterm birth and other perinatal outcomes.

This tool specifically aims to educate users, communicate information
clearly, and serve as a resource to inform programmatic decision-making.
