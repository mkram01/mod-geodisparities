#### Motivation

Identifying plausible causal contributors to preterm birth, and to
racial and geographic disparities in PTB specifically, requires more
than a list of statistical correlations with a jumble of contextual
indicators.

Social theory points to the importance of fundamental drivers of
between-race access to material, social, and human capital as necessary
for the reproduction of disparity observed in preterm birth (17).

Epidemiologic theory points to the distinction between the ‘causes of
cases’ (e.g. individual risk factors) and the ‘causes of causes’ (e.g.
contextual determinants of between-group difference) (18), with the
latter being of critical importance for investigating racial
disparities.
