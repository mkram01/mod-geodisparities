**Mapping the Social Epidemiology of Preterm Birth**
====================================================

<br>

Despite decades of clinical and population research, the problem of
large and unacceptable racial, economic, and geographic disparities in
preterm birth persist(1,2). As a perinatal and social epidemiologist,
Dr. Kramer has been a leader advancing empirical research, advanced
analytic methods, and interdisciplinary research focused specifically on
racial and geographic disparities in womenâ€™s and childrenâ€™s health,
and preterm birth in particular. He has published 38 peer-reviewed
papers and 3 book chapters on health equity and pregnancy outcomes, and
46 peer-reviewed papers and 3 book chapters on broader maternal and
child health outcomes, health equity, and geosocial epidemiology.

Inadequate integration of theoretical and methodological insight from
clinical, epidemiologic, and social science research impedes progress
towards impactful action to eliminate inequity in preterm birth and
other perinatal outcomes. This project is a multi-step workflow aimed to
lay the groundwork for next steps in the March of Dimes Center for
Social Science Research. Specifically focusing on goals to ***estimate,
associate, and disseminate***, this project is designed as a jumping off
point for further conversations in the role of consultant research with
March of Dimes.
