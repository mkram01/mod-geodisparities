                                                  <strong><em>lower risk</em></strong>. To assign a map color to each county, the
                                                  counties are ranked from lowest to highest, and then categorized into 5 groups,
                                                  each with an equal number of counties (‘quintiles’). This makes it easy to see

                                                  big the absolute differences are between color categories. To see the

                                                  <li>Preterm birth is not just one thing, but is really the outcome from a mix of many 
                                                  different disease processes (it is a ‘heterogeneous outcome’)! What this means is that 
                                                  the causes (and solutions) are not the same for every baby born preterm. It is difficult 
                                                  to account for all of these differences using only birth certificate data. But one way
                                                  to begin to see differences is by looking at the severity of prematurity. For instance 
                                                  babies born at <32 weeks gestation (sometimes called ‘very preterm birth’) have much 
                                                  higher risk for morbidity and mortality than babies born just one week before 37 weeks 
                                                  of gestation (more generally called ‘preterm birth’). Not only are the consequences 
                                                  different, but in some instances the causes or reasons for prematurity may be different. 
                                                  For instance, it is very unlikely that any baby would be intentionally delivered (e.g. 
                                                  labor induction or cesarean section) before 32 weeks except in the most serious of 
                                                  situations. But it is much more common for obstetric decision making about labor 
                                                  induction or cesarean section to play a role in late preterm births. Therefore the 
                                                  underlying drivers of each may be different (e.g. maternal health or chronic stress 
                                                  may play a relatively larger role in the case of very preterm birth; obstetric management 
                                                  and health care practices playing a larger role in preterm birth).

                                                  In the plot below we show how the risk for preterm birth (<37 weeks) correlates with 
                                                  the risk for very preterm birth (<32 weeks) <em>in the very same counties.</em>  Obviously the 
                                                  absolute risk is different between these two outcomes, but we do see that they are 
                                                  correlated. As the risk for one goes up in a county, we tend to see the risk of the 
                                                  other go up.  But one thing that is notable is that the two outcomes are not <em>perfectly 
                                                  correlated.</em> In other words One way to see how these outcomes might have different 
                                                  patterns is to examine the relationship between the county-level risk of Preterm Birth
                                                  (<37 weeks) and the risk in the same counties of Very Preterm Birth (<32 weeks). 
                                                  Obviously, very preterm birth (<32 weeks) occur far less frequently than overall preterm
                                                  births (<37 weeks). In this plot, there is clearly a correlation in the rates of these 
                                                  two related outcomes for both Black and White women. However, it is also clear that the 
                                                  two rates do not correlate perfectly. In other words some counties are relatively higher
                                                  for Preterm Birth but relatively lower for Very Preterm Birth. This pattern is especially

                                                  GeoDisparities Mapper uses a mapping rule that ranks all counties in a single maps from the 
                                                  lowest to the highest risk, and then groups them into 5 equally sized categories (‘quintiles’).  
                                                  The colors are assigned to these categories from the lowest (lighter color) to highest 
                                                  (darker color).   If two maps are side by side, the colors in one map do not necessarily 
                                                  reflect the same absolute risk as that color in another  map. It is always important to look
                                                  at the map legend to understand what the colors represent.

                                                  inequity in perinatal outcomes is due to historical inequality by race and 
                                                  socioeconomic opportunity, factors that not only affect pregnancy, but can

                                                  <li>In the United States it is quite common to ‘measure’ health disparities 
                                                  (health inequity) between two groups by dividing the risk of one group by the
                                                  risk of another. We may call this measure a <em>risk ratio.</em> The interpretation of
                                                  a <em>risk ratio</em> of 1.0 is that both groups have equal risk for the outcome. 
                                                  In contrast a risk ratio of 1.5 and 2.0 mean that the high-risk group has either 
                                                  50% increased risk or 100% increased risk (double the risk) as compared to the 
                                                  lower risk group. You may have seen these measures used for describing racial 
                                                  disparities in perinatal outcomes.

                                                  <li>But there are other ways to monitor population health equity. One other
                                                  measure is a <em>risk difference</em> rather than ratio. Instead of dividing 
                                                  the risk in one group by the other, a <em>risk difference</em> subtracts the 
                                                  risk in one group from another (e.g. takes the absolute arithmetic difference). 
                                                  Why would this tell us anything different from the <em>risk ratio?</em> Because
                                                  the same <em>absolute</em>  difference in risk will produce a different 
                                                  <em>relative</em> (ratio) gap when the lower-risk group is doing better or worse.

                                                  counties against the Black-White <em>risk difference</em> for the very same 
                                                  counties. Clearly the two values are generally correlated (go up together). 
                                                  But looking at counties along the purple line (representing a three-fold higher
                                                  risk of very preterm birth among Black women as compared to White women), we can
                                                  see that there are a range of Black-White <em>risk differences.</em> The colors 
                                                  in this plot demonstrate how much the risk for very preterm birth in each county
                                                  among the lower risk group (non-Hispanic White women) varies. In counties where 
                                                  White women have low risk (colored blue), and a Black-White <em>risk ratio</em>
                                                  of 3.0, the Black-White <em>risk difference</em> is low (between 11 and 13 per 
                                                  1,000 births). But if we look at counties where White women have higher risk 
                                                  (colored red), the very same Black-White <em>risk ratio</em> of 3.0 results in 
                                                  a Black-White <em>risk difference</em> of 15-18.

                                           counties. In County A, non-Hispanic White women have a 1% risk for very preterm birth 
                                           (<32 weeks), while non-Hispanic Black women have a 3% risk.  In County B, non-Hispanic
                                           White women have a risk of 2% and non-Hispanic Black women have a 4% risk.   It is clear
                                           that in each county Black women have a risk for very preterm birth that is 2% higher 
                                           in absolute terms. In other words, the Black-White disparity measured with an <em>absolute
                                           risk difference</em> is 2 excess very preterm births per 100 births. However, if we measured
                                           the disparity with the <em>relative risk ratio,</em> in County A, Black women have three-times 
                                           (<em>risk ratio 3% / 1% = 3.0</em>) the risk for very preterm birth. In County B, Black 
                                           women have two-times the risk (4% / 2% = 2.0).

                                           in those same counties the Black-White racial disparity is relatively <u><em>smaller</em></u>
                                           when using the <em>relative risk ratio</em> measure. This is because the risk for very preterm
                                           birth is higher for <em>both Black and White</em> women in Deep Southern counties as compared

                                           they tell slightly different stories about where disparities in perinatal outcomes are larger
                                           or smaller.  Making maps of health equity can be a useful complement to maps of only risk in 
                                           the whole population or for individual racial or ethnic groups. However it is important to 
                                           consider whether a large or small disparity is because both groups are doing well or both 
                                           are doing poorly.

                                                  the United States is collected by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).
                                                  These records include the gestational age and weight of the infant at birth,

                                                  rather than an <u><em>estimate?</u></em> We believe the answer is ‘no’ for two reasons.

                                                  <li>The second reason is that, even if we could share the actual count of preterm 
                                                  births for every county, the statistics would be considered <u><em>“unreliable”</em></u>
                                                  or <u><em>“unstable”</em></u> for many counties where there are not very many births 
                                                  to the specific race/ethnic group being mapped.  Imagine there are two counties, each 
                                                  measured for three separate years. The number of live births stayed the same in each
                                                  county for all three years. However each year, perhaps due to random chance, there 
                                                  was one additional baby born preterm than the previous year.  In County B, the risk 
                                                  of preterm birth is very <u><em>stable</em></u> around 10%. In other words the 
                                                  relatively random fluctuation of one or two more or fewer preterm babies did not 
                                                  change the estimate of risk very much. In contrast, in County B the risk ranged from
                                                  0% to 20%, both very extreme values for preterm birth. This is because there are not
                                                  many births at risk in County A. When there are a very small number of births or 
                                                  very few poor outcomes (e.g. ‘sparse data’), the calculated risk can be statistically
                                                  unreliable or unstable, and can easily take on unreasonably extreme values.

                                                  (e.g. in a specific race/ethnic group in a specific county).  To the extent that

                                                  resulting estimate is more useful for comparing across counties or across years. 
                                                  In other words the estimation process aims to describe what is really different 
                                                  about risk without too many extreme swings that are due only to sparse data and random
                                                  chance.

                                                  uses sophisticated spatio-temporal statistical models called Bayesian disease mapping.
                                                  The more technical details of the modeling procedure are described below. However in 
                                                  broad terms, it is well known that, on average, the risk in one year is more correlated
                                                  with the risk in the previous year than it is with risk much longer ago. Similarly, on 
                                                  average, the risk in one county is more similar to the risk in nearby counties than it
                                                  is to a randomly selected, distant county. Of course there are exceptions to both 
                                                  situations. However the Bayesian disease mapping approach is a way to stabilize risk 
                                                  estimates from sparse populations (counties or race/ethnic groups) by ‘borrowing 
                                                  statistical information’ about risk from the previous year(s) and from the nearby 
                                                  counties. This approach has been widely used by CDC, NCHS, and the World Health 
                                                  Organization to develop statistically reliable maps of geographic patterns of population health.
