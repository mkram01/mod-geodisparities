#### Motivation

Identifying plausible causal contributors to preterm birth, and to racial and geographic
disparities in PTB specifically, requires more than a list of statistical correlations with a jumble of contextual
indicators. 

Social theory points to the importance of fundamental drivers of between-race access to material,
social, and human capital as necessary for the reproduction of disparity observed in preterm birth (17).

Epidemiologic theory points to the distinction between the ‘causes of cases’ (e.g. individual risk factors) and
the ‘causes of causes’ (e.g. contextual determinants of between-group difference) (18), with the latter being of
critical importance for investigating racial disparities.
