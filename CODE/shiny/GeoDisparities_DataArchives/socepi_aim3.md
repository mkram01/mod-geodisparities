### **Aim 3:** ***Disseminate*** *results to inform the next phase research for the March of Dimes Center for Social Science Research*

<br>

Dissemination of results will include conventional avenues including
peer-reviewed publications. However in anticipation that this RFP will
lay some of the groundwork for subsequent MOD Request For Proposals, we
are disseminating some of the insight through this web-based data
exploration and mapping tool available to MOD stakeholders or even to
future research applicants.

To make the Bayesian estimates of preterm birth (very preterm, late
preterm, all preterm) and Black-White disparities (relative and
absolute), we are developing this interactive map and data visualization
dashboard using the Leaflet and Shiny application platform.

Dashboard design and audience could vary, but fundamentally they include
a mix of tools for visualizing (spatially in maps and aspatially in
scatter plots and other data plotting tools) relationships between
place, race, preterm birth, and the social, demographic and economic
indicators. User selection of variables to compare (e.g. via drop down
windows) will result in instant rendering of requested data. This
interactivity can spur consideration of critical issues (e.g. the
importance of disaggregating ‘preterm birth’ into specific sub- groups;
or importance of choice of disparity measures), and propel development
of new hypothesis-driven research leveraging insight from clinical,
epidemiologic, and social science perspectives.
