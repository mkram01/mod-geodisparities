**Aim 1:** ***Estimate*** *and map valid small area indicators of preterm birth equity in US counties.*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Motivation

In this aim, four vital areas rarely all incorporated into research on
geography of preterm birth disparities are addresed, but which together
strengthen the resulting inference.

1.  Perinatal epidemiology has detailed how heterogeneous preterm birth
    defined as all births &lt;37 weeks is (e.g. in terms of diverse
    biological pathways and clinical presentation). As a result,
    uncritical use of &lt;37 weeks as a target parameter in population
    research may mask important findings or patterns which are
    restricted to specific subsets (e.g. very preterm birth or
    spontaneous preterm birth)(3â€“5).

2.  Social epidemiology and health geography have illustrated
    substantial small area variation in population health arising from
    local variation in social and economic context. Counties represent
    the smallest consistently defined geographic unit at which social
    policy can be implemented and resources allocated (6,7).

3.  This third area is a consequence of the second, and that is
    attention to valid estimation of health outcomes for small
    populations (e.g. race groups within sparsely populated counties).
    Much past research has ignored instability from sparse event counts
    likely biasing findings not only from measurement error, but from
    the socially-selected nature of the sparse data.

4.  Fourth, health equity scholars are often uncritical of the choice of
    measure of â€˜disparityâ€™, relying most often on the â€˜relative
    excessâ€™ or risk ratio approach (e.g. Black women have 1.5 times
    the risk of PTB as White women).As Harper, et al (8) observe,
    measures of â€˜equityâ€™ are inherently value laden, and inattention
    to a measuresâ€™ implicit values diminishes clarity at best, and can
    give frankly incorrect answers in some instances. For example,
    relative measures emphasize proportionate deviations from equality;
    alternatively absolute differences in PTB risk emphasizes the
    absolute excess burden experienced by one group and speak to the
    number of lives impacted by prematurity.

### Methodology

Our group currently has access to restricted-access NCHS natality
records from 1989-2016. To achieve this Aim and address the four
critical areas described above, we will estimate (and map) the
prevalence of very preterm birth (&lt;32 weeks); late preterm birth
(34-36 weeks); and preterm birth (&lt;37 weeks) for each U.S. county
overall, and for non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black women
separately.

We will further estimate (and map) the county-specific Black-White
relative and absolute disparities. To produce stable and valid estimates
of both the risks and the disparity measures we will implement spatial
Bayesian disease mapping techniques, which â€˜borrowâ€™ statistical
strength for spatiotemporal dependencies (9â€“11). These have been
widely validated, are frequently used, and my team has used them for
estimating perinatal and mortality parameters in US counties(12â€“16).

While some counties will still be suppressed (e.g. there are no Black
births in many counties), the number of counties with estimates is
substantially higher with these methods than when following NCHS
suppression rules, and all estimates are more valid than approaches
ignoring data sparseness (10).
