#### Motivation

In this aim, four vital areas rarely all incorporated into research on
geography of preterm birth disparities are addresed, but which together
strengthen the resulting inference.

1.  Perinatal epidemiology has detailed how heterogeneous preterm birth
    defined as all births &lt;37 weeks is (e.g. in terms of diverse
    biological pathways and clinical presentation). As a result,
    uncritical use of &lt;37 weeks as a target parameter in population
    research may mask important findings or patterns which are
    restricted to specific subsets (e.g. very preterm birth or
    spontaneous preterm birth)(3–5).

2.  Social epidemiology and health geography have illustrated
    substantial small area variation in population health arising from
    local variation in social and economic context. Counties represent
    the smallest consistently defined geographic unit at which social
    policy can be implemented and resources allocated (6,7).

3.  This third area is a consequence of the second, and that is
    attention to valid estimation of health outcomes for small
    populations (e.g. race groups within sparsely populated counties).
    Much past research has ignored instability from sparse event counts
    likely biasing findings not only from measurement error, but from
    the socially-selected nature of the sparse data.

4.  Fourth, health equity scholars are often uncritical of the choice of
    measure of ‘disparity’, relying most often on the ‘relative excess’
    or risk ratio approach (e.g. Black women have 1.5 times the risk of
    PTB as White women).As Harper, et al (8) observe, measures of
    ‘equity’ are inherently value laden, and inattention to a measures’
    implicit values diminishes clarity at best, and can give frankly
    incorrect answers in some instances. For example, relative measures
    emphasize proportionate deviations from equality; alternatively
    absolute differences in PTB risk emphasizes the absolute excess
    burden experienced by one group and speak to the number of lives
    impacted by prematurity.
